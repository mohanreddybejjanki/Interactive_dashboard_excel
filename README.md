# Interactive_Dashboard

I created dashboard in Excel based on the data of star-store. It includes data of sales of each month of 2022. It has gender, age data of customers.

I used the data to get meaningful data and solve some of the questions.Which include-

1.Top 5 states contributing to the Sales.
2.Who purchased more -Men or Women in 2022?
3.Relation between age and gender based on number of orders.
4.Compare the sales and orders using single chart.
5.Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
6.What are different order status in 2022.
7.Which month got highest sales and orders?

I created interactive dashboard,and options to see data based on various classification.
